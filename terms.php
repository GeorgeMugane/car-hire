         <p>These terms &amp; conditions, together with our website terms &amp; 
Conditions of use, privacy policy and security policy, constitute our 
agreement with you, the renter, for the services we provide in arranging
 for the supply of car hire. Acceptance of the services or signature on any 
agreement shall be deemed conclusive evidence of your acceptance of 
these terms. Your hire of any car is subject to the terms 
&amp; conditions of car hire imposed by the car hire company and to the 
corresponding laws of the country and/or state in which the rental takes
 place. Individual restrictions may also apply to your car hire.</p>
<p>These terms apply to any booking that you, the renter, make with us 
on or through this website, so you should make sure that you are aware 
of their contents. Both our terms &amp; conditions and those of the car 
hire companies we work with contain some exclusions and limitations of 
liability.</p>

<p>Your booking on this website is conditional on you, the renter, 
accepting our terms. If you, the renter, do not agree with any part of 
them, you must not proceed with your booking. By confirming that you 
wish to book a car through this website you, the renter, indicate that 
you have read and understood and accept the relevant terms. If there is 
any part that you, the renter, do not fully understand, or if you have a
 query about the car hire or any other product, please <a href="user_contact.php">Contact us</a>.</p>

<p>There may be some circumstances in which we do not know whether or 
not the car hire company has a particular car class available. This will
 be clearly indicated either before or after you, the renter, have sent 
your request through. In these cases we will put the car ‘on request’ 
with the car hire company. This means that although we cannot 
immediately confirm to you, the renter, that your requested car is 
available, we will use our reasonable endeavours to find it for you and 
will inform you of the outcome within 48 hours of your request. Where 
you, the renter, offer to hire a car or other product on this website at
 the suggested price, it may be accepted within 48 hours of you 
submitting your order (or up to 1 day before pick-up, if earlier). We 
will notify you, the renter, by return email and by emailing a booking 
confirmation if your offer has been accepted. Please note that you, the 
renter, will not have any contract for car hire at the price offered 
until your booking has been confirmed and the necessary payment 
received. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. 
Please note that any contract entered into will be with the individual 
actually booking the car and all correspondence will be sent to that 
address given, even where a third party actually pays for the hire. For 
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in our terms shall entitle any
 third party to any benefit or rights pursuant to the Contracts (Rights 
of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>
<p><strong>The rental voucher / eVoucher must be presented to 
the car hire company when picking up your hire car. We cannot be held 
responsible for rentals rejected if a voucher / eVoucher is not 
presented.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will not be held responsible for anyone driving under the 
influence of alcohol/drugs, causing wilful damage, driving off-road or 
driving without due care and attention. You, the renter, will accept 
full responsibility in respect of such claims. This list is not 
exhaustive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) </strong><br>
Collision Damage Waiver reduces the renter's liability from the total 
cost of the damage to an excess amount, where applicable, unless the 
renter intentionally causes the damage, is under the influence of drink 
or drugs, or uses the car in a prohibited or negligent way – such as 
driving off main roads or hiring to other parties. CDW covers liability 
for damage to the car or its parts. In most locations, windscreens, 
tyres, undercarriage, replacement locks, replacement keys and towing 
charges are not covered under the CDW policy. Other exclusions may apply
 and can differ between car hire companies, so we recommend checking 
these exclusions with the car hire company when picking the car up.</p>
<p>Examples of common exclusions from car hire companies’ CDW policies include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Damage caused to the windows, windscreen, glass, interior, personal belongings, wheels, tyres, roof or undercarriage</li>
	<li>Damage caused while the driver is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol</li>
	<li>Damage caused while the car is being driven by someone who is not a named driver on the rental agreement</li>
	<li>Towing charges or damage caused by the car being towed by an unauthorised third party</li>
	<li>Damage caused while the car is being driven negligently or without 
due care and attention, including driving off-road and on untarmacked 
roads</li></ul>
<p><strong>Theft Protection (TP) </strong><br>
Theft Protection reduces the renter's liability in the event of theft or
 damage caused due to theft or attempted theft of the car to an excess 
amount, where applicable. Negligence connected with the theft of/damage 
to the car may lead to the car hire company requiring the full amount 
for the cost of the car.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum / Maximum Age Limitations</strong><br>
In most locations, the minimum hiring age is 21 years. Additional fees 
can apply with certain car hire companies and in certain countries for 
drivers aged under 25 years or over 65 years: where the correct driver 
age has been submitted with the booking request, we will advise of any 
likely fees. Minimum age requirements on larger cars may also be higher 
at some locations. Please check with our Contact Centre if you, the 
renter, have any questions or concerns about this matter.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Drivers </strong><br>
Fees may apply for additional drivers, payable at the car hire counter 
(unless otherwise specified on the rental voucher / eVoucher). 
Please check with our Contact Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Rate Calculations / Periods of Hire / Period of Hire Extensions</strong><br>
The price of your car hire will be confirmed at time of booking and 
calculated on the basis of 24-hour units. If you, the renter, wish to 
extend the period of hire after picking the car up, or if you drop the 
car off later than stated on your voucher / eVoucher, the contract for 
such an extension will always be with the car hire company directly and 
the extra time will be charged for by the car hire company at the local 
daily rate, which may be higher than the rates agreed with us at the 
time of booking.</p>
<p><strong>Late Pick-ups / Early Drop-offs </strong><br>
Your rental starts and finishes according to the pick-up and drop-off 
dates and times detailed on your voucher / eVoucher. Unfortunately, we 
are unable to provide refunds for unused time if a car is picked up late
 or dropped off early. If you are unable to pick the car up at the 
agreed time and date, it is essential you contact us as soon as 
possible. If you do not, there is no guarantee that the car will still 
be available – and you will not be entitled to any refund.</p>
<p><strong>If You, the Renter, Wish to Make Changes to Your Booking </strong><br>
No charge will be made for amending your booking before the start of 
your rental. To cancel your booking, please log in to the Amend/Cancel 
Booking facility, and click Cancel Booking
</p>
<p><strong>If We Make Changes to Your Booking </strong><br>
Occasionally it may be necessary for changes to be made to your booking 
(after acceptance) by us or by the car hire company. In all such cases 
we will advise you, the renter, as soon as reasonably possible before 
pick-up and, if the proposed changes are unacceptable, you will be 
offered a full refund. However, in such circumstances, we shall have no 
additional liability in respect of any direct or indirect losses you may
 suffer as a result of such changes.</p>
 <p><strong>Provision of Cars </strong><br>
Car hire companies reserve the right to refuse a car to any person who 
is considered unfit to drive or does not meet eligibility requirements. 
We will not be liable for the completion of travel arrangements, nor for
 any refund, compensation or any other costs you, the renter, may have 
to pay in such a case.</p>
 <p><strong>Mechanical Difficulties / Accidents</strong><br>
In the case of breakdown or mechanical difficulties, you, the renter, 
must call the car hire company immediately. The car hire company must 
give authority for repairs or replacement cars. If you, the renter, are 
involved in an accident, the local police and the car hire company must 
be contacted. Keep copies of all relevant documentation you are asked to
